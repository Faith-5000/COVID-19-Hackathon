# COVID-19-Hackathon
Theme: Creating a social-emotional app to help people deal with the stress of the covid-19 pandemic.

## Inspiration:
The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted everyone and has most likely caused lots of stress for a lot of people. We have seen many apps that are designed to display Covid-19 information or help screen people to see if they may or may not have the virus. But there isn't an app designed to help people cope with the stress that this pandemic has created. So we decided to create a social-emotional app aimed to help people deal with being in quarantine and managing the stress related to the pandemic.

## What it does: 
Cope with Covid gives people tips on how to deal with Covid-19 pandemic. You can choose from a variety of topics and then select an age group to get information specifically targeted towards that age group. Tips are meant for anyone and the information is provided in a thoughtful manner meant to reduce anxiety.

## How we built it:
We built this using Xcode and Swift. We started by coming up with a UI for the app. We wanted something that looked fun and would appeal to people of all ages. After having the UI designed in Figma we started designing it in Xcode using storyboards. This was relatively simple and using Xcode storyboards allowed us to create IBoutlets and IBactions to handle button presses, changing label text etc. After linking the UI to our code we split up and one person researched information to put into the app while someone else actually programmed it.

## Challenges we ran into: 
The biggest challenge was figuring out the logic to display specific information related to whatever the user clicked on. In the end we created a struct in Swift to handle this, which worked out pretty well. Another challenge was creating scroll views that worked properly. Our main programmer didn't have a lot of experience using scroll views but in the end they figured it out.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of: 
Creating a working app during the Hackathon that can be helpful to people around the world.

## What we learned: 
We learned how to research better, plan projects and follow through as well as learning some new programming techniques and image editing.

## What's next for Cope With Covid: 
We would like to add an AR game to the app to make it more entertaining because playing games can be a great stress reliever. We would also like to crowdsource and research more tips and information to give users more info that they can use. As well as setting up a notification feature that would give the user tips right from their home screen.
